- Performed initial data cleaning  
- Added basic features:
  - Number of words
  - Number of characters
  - Number of sentenses
- Did some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## 🔄 Day 2 Progress

- Continued EDA:
  - Compared spam and ham messages on character count, word count, and sentence count  
  - Visualized distributions using histograms and bar plots  
  - Generated WordClouds for spam and ham messages to highlight common words  
- Performed further preprocessing:
  - Implemented a custom preprocessing function (stopword removal, punctuation removal, stemming)  
  - Created a new column `transformed_text` with cleaned and processed text  
- Verified text cleaning effectiveness with sample outputs
